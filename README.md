### 📘 Udemy Clone Website (HTML & CSS)

This project is a simple Udemy-inspired online learning website created using basic HTML and CSS. The website replicates the front-end design of Udemy, including a navigation bar, course categories, featured courses section, and footer.

The homepage displays various course cards with images, titles, prices, and ratings. The layout is designed using Flexbox and basic CSS styling to ensure proper alignment and spacing. The website is fully static and focuses on practicing layout design, positioning, and responsive structure.

This project helps in understanding:

* HTML page structure
* CSS styling and layout
* Flexbox alignment
* Card design UI
* Navigation bar creation

It is a beginner-friendly front-end project created for learning and practice purposes.
